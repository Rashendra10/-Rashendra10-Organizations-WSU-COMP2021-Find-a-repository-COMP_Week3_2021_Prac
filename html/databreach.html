                <h3>What is a data breach?</h3>
                <p>A data breach happens when <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/your-privacy-rights/your-personal-information/what-is-personal-information/">personal information</a> is accessed, disclosed without authorization, or is lost. For example, when:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>a USB or mobile phone that holds an individual’s personal information is stolen</li>
                    <li>a database containing personal information is hacked</li>
                    <li>someone’s personal information is sent to the wrong person</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A data breach can harm an individual whose personal information is affected. They can, for example, suffer distress or financial loss.</p>
                <p>There are things you can do to reduce your risk of harm. And, there’s help available if you suffer distress.</p>
